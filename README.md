# Loan-Portfolio-Performance-Analysis-and-Prediction-

This Loan Portfolio Performance Analysis and Prediction project is conducted by using SQL and Python on loan portfolios, which involves developing loss rate projections and other critical credit risk analytics based on historical loan-level data.

Tableau dashboards are also created to visualize the origination characteristics and loan performances, generating reports and Tableau stories that offer actionable insights and recommendations.
